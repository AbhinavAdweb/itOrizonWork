# Getting Started
1) Import the project into eclipse
2) Either create a directory "D:\itOrizon" else change the "upload.path" & "lucene.index.path" property to a valid directory in the "application.properties" file.
3) Right Click on the project in Eclipse and "Run As" spring boot application.
4) Go to "localhost:8080" in your browser.
5) Note that this project creates "Lucene Indexes" everytime a valid "TSV" or "CSV" file is uploaded.
6) If indexes were already generated when you ran the application the last time, then you can skip to search page.
